This is a Flutter study project.

## Getting Started

Create `env.json` file and include this three variables:

```
{
    "API_KEY": "YOUR API_KEY FROM themoviedb.org",
    "API_TOKEN": "YOUR API_TOKEN FROM themoviedb.org",
    "BASE_URL": "https://api.themoviedb.org/3"
}
```
After that it's possible to run the project using:

```
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.json
```
